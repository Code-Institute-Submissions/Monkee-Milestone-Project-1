# Milestone Project 1
## Resources used
Google Fonts, Fontawesome, Bootstrap, Flexbox
### Description
A simple webite intended for Monkees fans new and old. Engineered to offer easy access to music and videos, upcoming live dates,a resposive gallery and a contact section. 
Title, Nav, Social links and About fixed to header/footer. Active Tab used to offer visual navigation. 
### Planning
The website was designed "mobile first" via Balsamiq. Balsamiq outputs uploaded separately. 
My initial ideas included a split Logo / Nav header that would present itself side-by-side on larger screens but then stack for smaller viewports - a similar effect was added to the footer. 
The colour-scheme of muted/faded blue, orange, and off-white was decided upon after a Google image search on the band as those were the colours that seemed to recurr. 
### Code Validation
All HTML pages vere validated via W3C
Similarly the doc style.css was validated.  
### Testing
Due to the importance of responsiveness to this project, great lenghts were taken to ensure that the website worked on various screen sizes and resolutions. 
The majority of this was achieved via Flexbox, Bootstrap Grid, and media queries.
